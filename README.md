A multi-tasking/multi-process operating system I wrote from scratch for the ATMega128 Microcontroller, to complete a thesis course CSC499 under the direction of Professor Steven Mann at the University of Toronto

This architecture was inspired by CSC472 - Microprossors systems taught by Professor Michael Stumm of the 
University of Toronto. 

It provides insights into operating systems engineering and multiplexing processes on a single core architecture.
Use it as you wish.
